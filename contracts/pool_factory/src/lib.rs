    /// contracts from disagreeing and removes a whole class of misconfiguration
    /// (a pool pointed at a registry that is not the one its invoices were
    /// checked against would reject invoices the invoice contract had already
    /// accepted). The factory's admin becomes the new pool's admin and its
