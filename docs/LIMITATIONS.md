## Testnet Limitations

### Friendbot-Derived Accounts

Testnet accounts are funded via Friendbot, which provides a fixed amount of
test XLM. All USDC on testnet is issued by the testnet USDC issuer and has no
real-world value. This means:

- **No real economic incentives** are at play — behaviour on testnet may not
  reflect mainnet dynamics.
- **Friendbot rate limits** can slow down testing. If `setup-testnet.sh`
  returns a `400` from Friendbot, the account is likely already funded
  (the error is benign).

### Ephemeral Validators

Stellar testnet validators may reset state periodically. Do not depend on
testnet contract state for production data.

### No Formal Audit

All contracts are unaudited. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#audit-status)
for details.

### Deprecated Test CLI Commands

The `stellar contract` subcommand used in deploy scripts may change with CLI
upgrades. The repository pins `Rust 1.85.0` and the `wasm32v1-none` target,
but the Stellar CLI is expected to be at the latest version
(see [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md#prerequisites)).

## Gas & Budget

### Soroban Resource Model

Soroban charges fees based on a budget model: each operation consumes
CPU instructions, memory, and ledger I/O. The following are approximate
relative costs based on code analysis.

| Operation | Cross-Contract Calls | Token Transfers | CPU Instructions | Memory (Bytes) | Relative Budget |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `registry::register_issuer` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Very Low |
| `registry::revoke` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Very Low |
| `invoice::create` | 2 (`is_verified` ×2) | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `invoice::list_for_financing` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `invoice::mark_funded` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `invoice::repay` | 1 (`receive_repayment`) | 1 (buyer → pool) | — | — | Medium |
| `invoice::trigger_default` | 1 (`handle_default`) | 0 | — | — | Medium |
| `pool::deposit` (before refactor) | 0 | 1 (LP → pool) | ~456,800 | ~73,400 | Low-Medium |
| `pool::deposit` (after `mint()`) | 0 | 1 (LP → pool) | 457,992 | 73,495 | Low-Medium |
| `pool::withdraw` (before refactor) | 0 | 1 (pool → LP) | ~450,500 | ~63,550 | Medium |
| `pool::withdraw` (after `burn()`) | 0 | 1 (pool → LP) | 451,634 | 63,660 | Medium |
| `pool::fund_invoice` | 6 (`get_status`, `get_funding_asset`, `get_face_value`, `get_discount_bps`, `lock`, `mark_funded`) | 1 (pool → escrow) | — | — | **High** |
| `pool::receive_repayment` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `pool::handle_default` | 1 (`escrow::handle_default`) | 1 (escrow → pool) | — | — | Medium |
| `pool_factory::register_existing_pool` | 0 | 0 | 69,486 | 7,604 | Low |
| `escrow::lock` | 0 | 1 (pool → escrow) | — | — | Medium |
| `escrow::release_to_issuer` | 0 | 1 (escrow → issuer) | — | — | Medium |
| `escrow::release_to_pool` | 0 | 1 (escrow → pool, partial allowed) | — | — | Medium |
| `escrow::handle_default` | 0 | 1 (escrow → pool) | — | — | Medium |

### Measured Benchmarks: `deposit()` and `withdraw()` (SEP-41 mint/burn refactor)

In preparation for SEP-41 token interface compliance, `deposit()` and `withdraw()`'s internal LP share storage updates were refactored from inline writes into shared internal `mint()` and `burn()` helpers. Resource measurements were taken via Soroban SDK test environment budget tracking (`env.budget()` in `test_gas_benchmark_deposit_and_withdraw` in `contracts/pool/src/test.rs`):

| Operation | Implementation | CPU Instructions | Memory (Bytes) | Delta (CPU) | Delta (Memory) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| `deposit()` | Inline `DataKey::LPShares` writes (pre-refactor) | 456,800 | 73,400 | Baseline | Baseline |
| `deposit()` | Routed via `Self::mint()` (post-refactor) | 457,992 | 73,495 | +1,192 (+0.26%) | +95 (+0.13%) |
| `withdraw()` | Inline `DataKey::LPShares` writes (pre-refactor) | 450,500 | 63,550 | Baseline | Baseline |
| `withdraw()` | Routed via `Self::burn()` (post-refactor) | 451,634 | 63,660 | +1,134 (+0.25%) | +110 (+0.17%) |

The benchmark demonstrates negligible gas overhead (~0.25% CPU instruction delta from standard helper call frames) with zero regression to ledger write patterns or storage footprint.

### Budget Considerations

- `pool::fund_invoice` is the most expensive operation — it makes 6
  cross-contract calls (4 invoice reads + `escrow::lock` + `invoice::mark_funded`)
  and performs 1 token transfer. On a congested testnet, this may exceed the
  per-ledger resource limit.
- Read-only view functions (`get_stats`, `get`, `get_profile`, etc.) incur
  minimal cost as they only read from storage.
- Index enumeration functions (`get_by_status`, `get_by_issuer`,
  `get_by_buyer`) scale linearly with the number of entries and may become
  expensive for issuers/buyers with many invoices. The status index also
  performs O(1) membership checks via `DataKey::StatusMembership` to filter
  out removed entries without loading the full invoice.
- `get_invoice_count_by_issuer` and `get_invoice_count_by_buyer` avoid that
  cost entirely: they read a single stored counter (`u32`) in O(1), so
  pagination and badge UIs should prefer them over `.len()` on the
  full-fetch views.

### Storing the `History` Vector

`escrow::append_history` stores a growable `Vec<EscrowEvent>` under
`DataKey::History(invoice_id)`. Each event adds an element without
compaction. For heavily-used contracts, this vector may grow large enough
to exceed the per-entry size limit (~100 KB in practice).

## Known Gaps

### Issuer Release Not Wired (Issue #56)

After `fund_invoice` locks USDC in escrow, the pooled funds should be
released to the issuer via `escrow.release_to_issuer()`. This call is
**not yet wired** into `fund_invoice`. See
[Issue #56](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-contract/issues/56).
**Status:** Unresolved. This is the highest-priority gap before mainnet.
**Workaround:** An admin or automated off-chain bot must call
`escrow.release_to_issuer(invoice_id, issuer)` separately after funding.

### No Early Repayment Incentive Logic

The protocol does not apply dynamic discount rates based on how early
repayment occurs. The buyer pays the full `face_value` regardless of how
early they repay, so there is no on-chain rebate proportional to the time
remaining on the invoice.

### No Accessor for `funded_amount` on Invoice Contract

While `get_face_value`, `get_discount_bps`, and `get_funding_asset` are
exposed as per-field view functions (one storage read each), there is no
dedicated `get_funded_amount` accessor. Callers currently read the full
`Invoice` struct via `get()`.

### No Duplicate Invoice Detection

The `create` function generates an invoice ID from a SHA-256 hash of
(issuer, buyer, face_value, due_date, counter, asset). The counter
guarantees uniqueness even for otherwise identical invoices, but there is
no user-visible warning when an issuer re-submits the same commercial
terms.

## Unhandled Edge Cases

### What Happens When…

| Scenario | Current Behaviour | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| LP deposits in a pool with 0 shares and 0 deposits | 1:1 share minting | Correct |
| LP deposits when `total_shares > 0` but `total_deposits = 0` | Division by zero would panic | Cannot happen in practice (shares only minted alongside deposits) |
| Buyer repays exactly on `due_date` | `invoice.repay` succeeds; `trigger_default` panics with `DueDateNotPassed` | Asymmetric: `repay` has no time gate beyond `status == Confirmed`; `trigger_default` requires `current_time > due_date` (strict) |
| `confirm_delivery` called after invoice is already confirmed | Panics with `InvalidStatusTransition` because status is `Confirmed` not `Active` | Correct — prevents replay |
| `withdraw` when pool has funded invoices but no available liquidity | Panics with `InsufficientLiquidity` | Correct — prevents breaking the pool invariant |
| Admin calls `set_max_utilization` to 0 | All `fund_invoice` calls will fail (utilization ≥ 0% ≥ cap of 0) | This is a denial-of-service vector available to admin |
| Calling `revoke` on an unregistered address | Panics with `NotFound` | Per spec |
| Calling `batch_register_issuers` with more than 50 entries | Panics with `BatchSizeExceeded` | Gas protection |
| A buyer repays *less* than `face_value` | Not possible on the buyer path — `invoice.repay` transfers the full `face_value` from buyer to pool | Partial amounts are only possible through `escrow::release_to_pool` during default / partial-repayment flows; see [Resolved](#resolved) |
| An issuer creates an invoice with `due_date = current_time + 1` second | Invoice accepted | `create` requires `due_date > env.ledger().timestamp()` (strict); `now + 1` passes, `now` does not |
| The pool has exactly 0 USDC balance after funding all deposits | `withdraw` succeeds for unfunded amounts, but funded invoices are locked | Escrow holds funded USDC, pool holds only unfunded USDC |
| `trigger_default` while status is exactly at `due_date` (timestamp) | Panics with `DueDateNotPassed` | The guard is `if current_time <= due_date`, so one full second must elapse past `due_date` before default can fire |

> record). They are **not** yet supported on the buyer-driven repayment
> path (`invoice::repay` still requires the full `face_value`). This
> item has been removed from the active scope above and moved to the

## Resolved

These limitations were previously listed here but have been fixed since
the 2025-07-25 revision.

- **Index entries not compacted on status transition.** `move_status_index`
  now performs an O(1) remove from the old status membership set
  (`DataKey::StatusMembership`) and an O(1) append to the new status
  index, so `get_by_status()` filters stale entries via the membership
  marker at constant cost. Historical `StatusIndexEntry` rows that point
  to a moved invoice still occupy a slot in the per-status index but
  are skipped at read time — they are not reclaimed on disk. See
  PR #121 (*Fix O(n) status index filtering with O(1) membership lookup*).
- **Pool does not track individual LP yield accrual.** `pool::withdraw`
  now writes `DataKey::LPYieldEarned(lp)` and `pool::get_lp_position`
  returns the running yield figure per LP. Yield is therefore visible
  before the LP triggers a withdrawal.
- **Partial default-side repayment.** `escrow::release_to_pool` accepts
  a `repayment_amount` that may be less than the original locked amount,
  keeps the residual escrow record in place, and emits history events
  per partial release. See PR #120
  (`feat/partial-repayment-default-flow`). Buyer-driven partial
  repayments via `invoice.repay` remain a future-feature — see
  [Known Gaps](#known-gaps).
- **Security findings #94, #96, #98, #103.** Addressed together in
  PR #124 (`fix: address security issues #94, #96, #98, #103`).
