## Trust Model

### Roles

| Role | Description | Trust Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Deployer address that calls `initialize()` on each contract. Controls profile management, default triggers, and configuration. | **High** — single point of failure |
| **Issuer** | A verified SME that creates invoices and requests funding. | Low — only self-authenticates |
| **Buyer** | A verified counterparty obligated to repay an invoice at maturity. | Low — only self-authenticates |
| **LP** | Liquidity provider that deposits USDC into a pool. | Low — only self-authenticates |
| **Anonymous caller** | Any Stellar account that can call permissionless functions. | None — no auth required |

### Trust Boundaries

   Verified via registry         Self-authenticated
   (issuer / buyer)              (LP deposits / withdrawals)
```

**Key trust assumption:** All contracts trust the addresses stored during
`initialize()` — if any stored reference is wrong, the caller loses funds
irrevocably.

## Authentication Gates

Every state-changing function enforces one of these auth patterns:

### Pattern A — Self-Auth (`address.require_auth()`)

The caller authenticates only themselves. No admin or third party is involved.

| Function | Contract | Who Auths |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `register_issuer` | Registry | The issuer address |
| `register_buyer` | Registry | The buyer address |
| `update_metadata` | Registry | The profile address |
| `create` | Invoice | The issuer |
| `list_for_financing` | Invoice | The issuer |
| `mark_shipped` | Invoice | The issuer |
| `confirm_delivery` | Invoice | The confirmer (issuer _or_ buyer) |
| `repay` | Invoice | The buyer |
| `check_auth` | Invoice | The supplied address |
| `deposit` | Pool | The LP |
| `withdraw` | Pool | The LP |

### Pattern B — Admin-Auth (`admin.require_auth()`)

Only the stored admin address may call this function.

| Function | Contract | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| `revoke` | Registry | Prevents unauthorised removal of profiles |
| `verify_profile` | Registry | Controls verification status |
| `batch_register_issuers` | Registry | Batch operations gated by admin |
| `set_pool_contract` | Invoice | Wiring a new pool changes fund flows |
| `set_expiry_window` | Invoice | Configuration parameter |
| `expire_listing` | Invoice | Admin fallback path |
| `fund_invoice` | Pool | (*currently*) Capital allocation from pool |
| `set_max_utilization` | Pool | Risk parameter |
| `transfer_ownership` | All | Changes the admin key |

### Pattern C — Cross-Contract Auth (`contract.require_auth()`)

One contract authenticates as the caller of another contract's function.

| Function | Contract | Authenticated Caller | Why |
|----------|----------|---------------------|-----|
| `mark_funded` | Invoice | The pool contract | Prevents faking funding records |
| `receive_repayment` | Pool | The invoice contract | Prevents faking repayment events |
| `receive_repayment_with_refund` | Pool | The invoice contract | Same as above |
| `handle_default` | Pool | The invoice contract | Prevents premature default recovery |
| `lock` | Escrow | The pool contract | Only the pool can lock funds |
| `release_to_issuer` | Escrow | The pool contract | Only the pool can release to issuer |
| `release_to_pool` | Escrow | The pool contract | Only the pool can reclaim escrowed funds |

### Pattern D — Dual-Auth (two `require_auth()` calls)

Two distinct parties must both sign.

| Function | Contract | Signers |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `initialize` | All | The incoming admin (prevents assigning an uncontrolled address) |
| `transfer_ownership` | All | Current admin + new admin (prevents accidental transfers) |

### Pattern E — Permissionless (no auth)

Any account can call these.

| Function | Contract | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `get_profile`, `is_verified`, `get_verification_status`, `get_admin` | Registry | Read-only views |
| `get`, `get_status`, `get_face_value`, `get_discount_bps`, `get_funding_asset`, `get_issuer`, `get_by_status`, `get_by_issuer`, `get_by_buyer`, `get_invoice_count_by_issuer`, `get_invoice_count_by_buyer`, `get_counts`, `get_expiry_window` | Invoice | Read-only views |
| `get_locked`, `get_history` | Escrow | Read-only views |
| `get_stats`, `get_lp_position`, `get_utilization_rate`, `get_usdc_asset` | Pool | Read-only views |
| `expire_listing` | Invoice | Also callable by issuer (Pattern A) |
| `trigger_default` | Invoice | Callable by any account once `now >= due_date` |

## Attack Vectors

### 1. Admin Key Compromise

**Risk:** The admin key controls profile revocations, pool funding,
and ownership transfer. Compromise of this key has a high blast radius.

**Mitigation:**
- `transfer_ownership` requires dual auth (current + new admin) — a stolen key
  cannot transfer ownership to the attacker without the new key also signing.
- The escrow `handle_default` has an alternative caller (pool contract), so
  admin compromise does not grant unilateral fund recovery.
- **Planned:** Multi-sig admin (see [Roadmap section in README](../README.md#known-centralization-risks--roadmap)).

### 2. Cross-Contract Spoofing

**Risk:** A malicious contract deployed at the same address as a legitimate
contract could fake `require_auth()` calls.

**Mitigation:**
- Contract addresses are hardcoded during `initialize()` and cannot be changed
  without admin auth.
- The invoice contract checks the pool address on every `mark_funded` call,
  and the pool checks the invoice address on `receive_repayment` and `handle_default`.

### 3. Dust-Attack on Pool Shares

**Risk:** After the pool accrues yield, the share price rises above 1.0.
A tiny deposit can round down to 0 shares while the USDC is still transferred
into the pool, effectively donating the depositor's funds to existing LPs.

**Mitigation:** The `deposit()` function rejects any deposit that would mint
0 shares with `PoolError::MinimumDeposit (#14)`. The check runs before the
token transfer, so no funds leave the depositor on the rejection path.

### 4. Replay of State Transitions

**Risk:** An attacker could try to call state-transition functions multiple
times on the same invoice (e.g., double-funding).

**Mitigation:** Every state transition in the invoice contract checks the
current status before proceeding. `list_for_financing` only works on `Created`
invoices; `mark_funded` only on `Listed`; `mark_shipped` only on `Funded`;
`confirm_delivery` only on `Active`; `repay` only on `Confirmed`; and
`trigger_default` only on `Funded`/`Active`/`Confirmed`. Once the status
advances, the previous function cannot be called again.

Additionally, escrow's `lock()` function rejects re-locking an already-locked
invoice with `EscrowError::AlreadyLocked`.

### 5. Integer Over/Underflow

**Risk:** Arithmetic errors in amount calculations could lead to incorrect
fund allocations.

**Mitigation:**
- All contracts use Rust `u128` for amounts. The release profile enables
  `overflow-checks = true` (see [Cargo.toml](../Cargo.toml)).
- `receive_repayment` validates `amount >= funded_amount`.
- `receive_repayment_with_refund` validates `refund <= amount - funded_amount`.
- `withdraw` validates `shares <= lp_shares` and `usdc_to_return <= available`.
- `handle_default` in the pool uses `saturating_sub` for deposit reduction.
- The invoice's `repay` functions use `saturating_sub` for discount calculations.

### 6. Front-Running on Invoice Expiry

**Risk:** An attacker could front-run an `expire_listing` call to fund an
invoice that would otherwise expire.

**Mitigation:** `expire_listing` only succeeds when `current_time > listed_at
+ expiry_window`. If the expiry window has passed, anyone can call
`expire_listing`, but a funder could still call `fund_invoice` in the same
ledger (before `expire_listing`). This is an accepted race condition given
the current permissionless funding model.

### 7. Utilization Cap Bypass

**Risk:** An admin could set `max_utilization_bps` above 10000 (100%) to
allow over-leveraging the pool.

**Mitigation:** `set_max_utilization` validates `new_cap_bps <= 10000` and
rejects values above 10000.

### 8. Batch Registration Overflow

**Risk:** An attacker could submit a very large batch of issuers to exhaust
gas or storage.

**Mitigation:** `batch_register_issuers` limits entries to `≤ 50` and
panics with `RegistryError::BatchSizeExceeded` otherwise.

## Centralization Risks

| Risk | Current State | Planned Mitigation |
|------|---------------|--------------------|
| Single admin key | Admin is a single Stellar address | Multi-sig (3-of-5) before mainnet |
| Admin-gated `fund_invoice` | Pool funding requires admin auth | LP-governed allocation (see [README](../README.md#known-centralization-risks--roadmap)) |
| No emergency pause | No circuit breaker exists | `admin_pause() / admin_unpause()` before mainnet |
| Centralised registry | Admin controls all registrations/revocations | On-chain governance (longer-term) |
| Single oracle for verification | Registry is the sole source of truth for identity | Multi-sig registry admin |

### Blast Radius: Admin Key

If the admin key is compromised or malicious:

| What They Can Do | What They Cannot Do |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Revoke any profile | Transfer admin to a non-consenting address (dual auth) |
| Register fraudulent profiles | Directly withdraw LP funds |
| Set a new pool contract | Trigger defaults before due date (`now >= due_date` enforced on-chain) |
| Change pool utilization cap (≤10000 bps) | Bypass the utilization cap (>10000 bps) |
| Expire listings | Mint unbacked LP shares |
| | Release escrowed funds to themselves (only pool contract can) |

## Defence-in-Depth

### Separation of Concerns

- **Registry** has no access to any funds.
- **Escrow** holds USDC but cannot release it without the pool contract.
- **Pool** manages accounting but does not hold USDC directly (it holds a
  balance from deposits, but escrow holds funded amounts).
- **Invoice** is a pure state machine with no fund custody.

### TTL Management

Every `persistent().set()` is immediately followed by `extend_ttl()` with
`live_until_ledger` = 100 and `seq` = 2_000_000. Instance storage is also
extended on every state-changing call via `extend_instance_ttl()`.

See [STORAGE.md](./STORAGE.md) for the full storage key schema and TTL
parameters.

### No External Dependencies Beyond Stellar

The contracts depend only on `soroban-sdk` and each other. There are no
oracle integrations, bridge contracts, or off-chain relayers whose compromise
could affect on-chain state.

## Out-of-Scope

The following are explicitly outside this threat model:

- **Stellar protocol-level attacks** (consensus, validator compromise, etc.)
  — report to [Stellar Development Foundation](https://stellar.org).
- **Freighter / wallet vulnerabilities** — report to the respective wallet team.
- **Frontend phishing or social engineering** — users are responsible for
  verifying transaction details before signing.
- **Off-chain indexer downtime** — the contracts function independently of
  the indexer; missed events do not affect fund safety.
- **Testnet-only risks** (Friendbot dust, ephemeral validators) — see
  [LIMITATIONS.md](./LIMITATIONS.md).
